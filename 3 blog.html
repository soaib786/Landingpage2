        A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town (although
        the word is often used to describe both hamlets and smaller towns),[3][4] with a population typically ranging
        from a few hundred to a few thousand. Although villages are often located in rural areas, the term urban village
        is also applied to certain urban neighborhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however,
        transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered
        broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.</p>

        In the past, villages were a usual form of community for societies that practice subsistence agriculture and
        also for some non-agricultural societies. In Great Britain, a hamlet earned the right to be called a village
        when it built a church.[5] In many cultures, towns and cities were few, with only a small proportion of the
        population living in them. The Industrial Revolution attracted people in larger numbers to work in mills and
        factories; the concentration of people caused many villages to grow into towns and cities. This also enabled
        specialization of labor and crafts and the development of many trades. The trend of urbanization continues but
        not always in connection with industrialization. Historically, homes were situated together for sociability and
        defence, and land surrounding the living quarters was farmed. Traditional fishing villages were based on artisan
        fishing and located adjacent to fishing grounds.</p>

    <p> In toponomastic terminology, the names of individual villages are called Comonyms (from Ancient Greek κώμη /
        village and ὄνυμα / name, [cf. ὄνομα]).[6]</p>
