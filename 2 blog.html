    <p>Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions among rational agents.[1] It has
        applications in many fields of social science, used extensively in economics as well as in logic, systems
        science
        and computer science.[2] Traditional game theory addressed two-person zero-sum games, in which a participant's
        gains
        or losses are exactly balanced by the losses and gains of the other participant. In the 21st century, game
        theory
        applies to a wider range of behavioral relations, and it is now an umbrella term for the science of logical
        decision
        making in humans, animals, as well as computers. <br>

        Modern game theory began with the idea of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum game and its proof by
        John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings into
        compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper was
        followed by Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944), co-written with Oskar Morgenstern, which considered
        cooperative games of several players.[3] The second edition provided an axiomatic theory of expected utility,
        which
        allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under uncertainty.[4]

        Game theory was developed extensively in the 1950s, and was explicitly applied to evolution in the 1970s,
        although
        similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an
        important
        tool in many fields. John Maynard Smith was awarded the Crafoord Prize for his application of evolutionary game
        theory in 1999, and fifteen game theorists have won the Nobel Prize in economics as of 2020, including most
        recently
        Paul Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson.
